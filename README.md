# cppplayer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stkw0/cppplayer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stkw0/cppplayer)

Music player that wants to be simple and easy to configure (I use it as an alternative to mpd)

In the past it was a serious game, but now it only is a game and a useful application for myself

I don't have a roadmap, I simply add features that are useful for my day to day.
