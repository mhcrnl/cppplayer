=== Compiling & Installing ===

Obviously, we need to clone and create the build directory

	git clone https://github.com/stakewinner00/cppplayer
	cd cppplayer
	mkdir build; cd build

Then we have some flags we can change at compile time. 
First, we have the build type, currently there are 4 build types, RELEASE, DEBUG, THREAD and ADDRESS.

The RELEASE type enables -O3 and -flto compiler flags. 
The DEBUG type enables -ggdb -Og and -DDEBUG compiler flags and enables a verbose output for debugging purpose.
The THREAD type enables the same of DEBUG type plus -fsanitize=thread for detecting data races.
The ADDRESS type enables the same of DEBUG type plus -fsanitize=address for detecting data leaks.

Then we can define the protocols we want to use, for now there are _NAMED_PIPE and _TCP_SOCKET.

If we wanted to compile with DEBUG build type and with _TCP_SOCKET enable and _NAMED_PIPE disabled, but with _TCP_SOCKET enabled we can execute
	
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug -D_NAMED_PIPE=Off -D_TCP_SOCKET=On ..

Once this is done we can compile with

	make

or if we want verbose output

	make VERBOSE=1

For installing we can execute

	sudo make install

It will copy the commands.h header to /usr/include/cppplayer/commands.h and the executable to /usr/local/bin/dplayer++

NOTES / LIMITATIONS: Currently only of the two protocols can be used (this will change soon).


=== Configuration ===

All the information and related files will be located in ~/.config/player++/. The configuration file used by the daemon is called daemon.conf. 
For default if the file doesn't exist, it will be created with the default values. If some value is not especified, it will use default values.

We can write these configuration for our own, or if our music folder is located in ~/Music, let the daemon to use the default values (for default the daemon search if the ~/Music directory exists, and in that case play the music inside of the directory recursively). 

Currently the configuration file have the next options.
pid_file: Is the location of the pid file used for detecting daemons already running. Default is ~/.config/player++/player++.pid

db_file:Is the location of the sql database, currently unused

music_folder: Is the directory where the music is searched. Default is . or ~/Music if exists

auto_start: A boolean that says if the status of the daemon should change from Stop to Playing automatically. Default is false

Inside section [tcp].

port_number: Port number used for receiving orders and sending information to clients. Default is 6600

bind_address: Address used for listening connections. Default is 0.0.0.0

Inside section [fifo]

daemon_pipe: Location of the pipe that the daemon uses for reading from clients. Default is: ~/.config/player++/dplayer++

client_pipe: Location of the pipe that the client uses for reading from daemon. Default is ~/.config/player++/cplayer++


=== Running & Scripting === 

For default the player will not fork so if some error happens, it will be printed on the console.
If we want to run it as a daemon, we could add the "-d" flag.

Once we have the daemon running, we can use some more usable clients like https://github.com/stakewinner00/cl_cppplayer for a client console or https://github.com/stakewinner00/web_cppplayer for a web client, but we can use bash too.

If we want to use bash first we should 

	source /usr/include/cppplayer/commands.h 

so we don't need to remember or search for the hexadecimal number for each command.
Supposing we are using named pipes, and the pipes are in the default location. We can:
	cd ~/.config/player++
	
	#pause/play the reproduction, if status=pause it will change to play, if status=play it will change to pause
	echo -n $CPPPLAYER_PAUSE > ./dplayer++

	#forward to the next song
	echo -n $CPPPLAYER_NEXT > ./dplayer++

	#get the current artist name
	echo -n $CPPPLAYER_GET_ARTIST > ./dplayer++; sed q cplayer++

	#get current volume
	echo -n $CPPPLAYER_VOLUME_GET > ./dplayer++; sed q cplayer++

	#set volume to 50
	echo -n $CPPPLAYER_VOLUME_SET"50" > ./dplayer++

etc, to see all supported commands you can read the /usr/include/cppplayer/commands.h  header file
